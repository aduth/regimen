# Regimen

A workout progression planning web app.

## About

Regimen helps you plan the progression of your workouts. Choose from a number of popular weightlifting routines to generate a customized plan to help you achieve your goals.

## Contributing

If you'd like to run your own instance of Regimen or contribute to the project, you must first ensure that Node.js is installed. You can download the latest version of Node from their [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, either download and extract the [latest zip](https://github.com/aduth/regimen/archive/master.zip) of this repository or, if you have `git` installed, clone the repository to a directory on your computer.

From your terminal or command line, enter the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aduth/regimen.git
```

Once cloned or extracted, change to the directory in your terminal, then install the required dependencies with `npm`:

```bash
$ cd regimen
$ npm install
```

After all of the dependencies have been installed, you can start a local development server by running `npm run dev`. Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser and you should see that the Regimen homepage is displayed.
